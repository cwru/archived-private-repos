# Zach Burklund Dev Work

This area contains information about the CWRU template project and Zach's connections to the group development effort.

## Overview of CWRU

CWRU-Framework is a responsive and multipurpose template set powered with [Twitter Bootstrap 3.3.6 Framework](http://getbootstrap.com). This framework has a huge collection of plugins and UI components and works seamlessly on all major web browsers, tablets and phones.

The CWRU-Framework is a combination of Bootstrap and over 70 "baked in" jQuery plugins that can be loaded if needed. Highlights include:


*   Bootstrap 3.3.6 Framework
*   jQuery 1.11.3
*   Written in SASS
*   Multiple image/video sliders
*   Responsive/accessivle tables
*   Parallax scrolling
*   Patturn Library
*   CWRU Templates

## Style Guide

The Style Guide in its current form is a boilerplate including many things that CWRU-Bootstrap will not need now, nor in the future. While we will remove items from the style guide that CWRU will not need, we are keeping the Bootstrap framework intact. This facilitates seemless Bootstrap updates in the future, and/or new additions to the style guide by the development team.

The Style Guide is our bible (right now our bible is bloated). In the future we will create a Patturn Library for assistance in building TERMINAL FOUR templates.
