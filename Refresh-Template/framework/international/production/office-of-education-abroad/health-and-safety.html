Whenever possible, bring enough of your prescription to last your entire study abroad experience. If refills are required while you are overseas, develop a plan with your doctor and in-country advisor. You may be able to fill the prescriptions overseas, or you may wish to have them mailed from home. Note that some FDA-approved medications (Ritalin, for example) are considered controlled substances in some countries. If you take such medicine, you may need a letter from your doctor and a letter from the Drug Enforcement Agency. Please consult with your study abroad advisor if you have any questions about taking medications abroad.</p>

For long-term study abroad, your semester/academic year study abroad institution will have information for you regarding recommended health facilities, many of which are on campus. For short-term study abroad, the leaders of faculty-led programs should be able to assist you in the event that you need medical care. Before leaving, investigate the services available to you knowing that these services vary.

Never use illegal drugs. In many countries, the penalties for illegal drug use are stricter than those of the United States, and some countries even administer the death penalty for illegal drug use. </p>

Alcohol may be consumed, but not abused, by students who are of legal age in their host countries. Students who choose to consume alcohol do so with the knowledge that they remain responsible for their actions at all times. CWRU discourages the use of alcohol in any of its education abroad activities, prohibits the illegal use of alcohol in the host country, and prohibits the distribution of alcohol to students who are not of legal drinking age in their host countries. Any student who commits an alcohol infraction—including drunkenness or any abuse of alcohol during study abroad—may be subject to university disciplinary action.</p>

Illegal activities place not only the individual but the group and the program in jeopardy. By virtue of enrolling in study abroad programs, all participants agree that they will refrain from using illegal drugs. The consequences of illegal drug use during the program may include immediate expulsion from the program, total forfeiture of all fees paid to the program, and loss of all course credit. In addition, diplomatic representatives and U.S. laws will be able to offer little or no help to students arrested and/or convicted of drug-related or other crimes. Program participants take responsibility—individually and as a group—for assuring that policies regarding illegal drugs are strictly observed.</p>

If a student becomes incapacitated due to alcohol overuse and/or illegal drug use, or if he or she needs medical attention, other participants are required to immediately seek medical treatment and contact the group leader in order to protect the health and well-being of the affected student. After providing appropriate follow-up, the leader should contact the CWRU Office of Education Abroad. </p>

                                                                <p>If you plan to be sexually active abroad, it is important to be aware of cultural views, norms and laws related to sexual activity. What might be accepted behavior in public in the United States could be culturally unacceptable abroad. Conversely, what might be seen as offensive in the U.S. could be common practice in your host country. The more you are aware of the norms, the easier your adjustment should be.</p>
                                                                <h3>Safe Sex and Contraception </h3>
                                                                <p>Contraception does not always meet the same quality standards in other countries, and in some areas it may be difficult to obtain. If you use oral contraceptives, bring a supply that will last for your entire study abroad experience, as these may be difficult to find. Also, it is highly recommended that men and women bring condoms from the U.S., even if you are not planning on being sexually active. If you have any questions about using contraception abroad, talk to your medical provider or the Office of Education Abroad before you go.</p>
                                                                <p>Sexually transmitted infectious diseases or infections (STDs or STIs)—such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and syphilis—continue to pose serious health risks in virtually every country. HIV, which is responsible for AIDS, is not only transmitted sexually but also through contaminated hypodermic needles and infected blood supplies. Please exercise caution, including the use of condoms, to prevent the spread of STDs.</p>
                                                                <h3>Sexual Misconduct</h3>

Sexual misconduct is a violation of that trust and respect and will not be tolerated. Members of the Case Western Reserve community have the right to be free from sexual misconduct, as well as domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. The <a href="https://students.case.edu/handbook/policy/sexual/">CWRU sexual misconduct policy</a> applies to all members of the community, including those studying abroad regardless of the cultural norms of the host country. The university strongly encourages persons who experience sexual misconduct to report the misconduct, to seek assistance and to pursue university action for their own protection and that of the entire campus community. Information on reporting can be found in the <a href="https://students.case.edu/handbook/policy/sexual/reporting.html">CWRU student handbook.</a></p>
