Global citizenship is promoted in many ways that are being pursued by faculty, staff and students throughout the university.</p>
                                                                <p>An important component of advancing global citizenship is to engage in working relationships with colleagues, universities and other institutions and governmental entities throughout the world. Our faculty, as well as all units of the university (department, school, etc.), are encouraged to both clarify and memorialize their relationships and future work by entering into formal agreements.</p>
                                                                <p>Instructions for seeking approval for non-research international agreements are described in the following sections:</p>

                                                                <p>A non-research international agreement is defined as any agreement that is not subject to approval by the Office of Research Administration (ORA) or by another university office (such as the Technology Transfer Office). If ORA or another office separately reviews an agreement for the quality of the proposal and partner institution, as well as legal compliance, then the process described below does not apply. </p>
                                                                <p>A completed approval form is required for approval of non-research international agreements, and will permit the president and provost, or their designees, to sign an agreement with an international institution, thereby obligating Case Western Reserve University.</p>

We provide support for faculty, departmental, and college efforts to initiate, develop and implement international agreements while protecting CWRU and individual faculty members as these legal documents are created.</p>
                                                                <a id="process" name="process"></a>

The steps below are designed to help faculty navigate this process. Every non-research international agreement that is signed on behalf of CWRU is required to go through the following process before it is considered a legal document. </p>
                                                                <p>If you have questions at any time during the process, contact the Center for International Affairs at <a href="mailto:agreements@case.edu">agreements@case.edu</a> or call 216.368.2517.</p>

                                                                <p>While it may seem obvious, identifying and understanding the international institution with which you are interested in entering into an agreement is a very important step. The international agreement must meet CWRU’s International Agreement Criteria as approved by the Faculty Senate in November 2013. A justification to this effect is required to be submitted with the agreement proposal.</p>
                                                                <p>The proposed international agreement should advance the mission of Case Western Reserve University. Factors that will help determine if such agreement will advance CWRU’s mission include whether: </p>

                                                                <h3>Step Two: Identify Agreement Type</h3>
                                                                <p>There are many different types of agreements into which CWRU can enter. Many of them are listed below, with General Counsel-approved templates for drafting the agreement. This list is not exhaustive, and proposers should develop agreements that match their own needs.</p>
                                                                <h4>Types of Agreements</h4>
                                                                <p><a href="/international/documents/global-strategy/CWRU Memorandum Of Understanding Template.docx">Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</a> is a standard document which facilitates future relationships with international partners. The MOU is a generic document which expresses the intent of both parties to explore possibilities for expanded relationships. A signed Memorandum of Understanding does not mean any financial commitment or legal commitment. It only opens the door for bilateral communication and negotiations so partners can negotiate specific international exchange agreements.</p>
                                                                <p><a href="/international/documents/global-strategy/CWRU Undergraduate Student Exchange Agreement Template.docx">Student Exchange Agreement</a>is a legal contract between two partners that allow for students to study or conduct research at the partner institution. The agreement can be reciprocal (two-way exchange of students) or non-reciprocal (one-way travel of students). An agreement may involve only undergraduate or graduate students or it may involve students at all academic levels. The template for International Student Exchange Agreement has details of all legal and financial commitments. However, any additional specific item of agreement may be inserted for review and approval.</p>
                                                                <p><a href="/international/documents/global-strategy/3+2_proposed_template.docx">3 + 2 Agreement</a> is a legal contract between two partners that allow for students, usually of the partner institution to spend three years in a degree seeking program at their home institution, apply to graduate school at CWRU, and, upon acceptance into graduate school, spend two years at CWRU working on a post-graduate degree. At the end of this time, the students would have a bachelor’s degree from the home institution and a graduate degree from CWRU. The template for 3 + 2 agreements has details of all legal and financial commitments; however, any additional specific item of agreement may be inserted for review and approval.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Faculty/Staff Exchange Agreement</strong> is a legal contract between two partners that allow for faculty and/or staff to teach, conduct research, or participate in training at the the partner institution. The agreement can be reciprocal (two-way exchange of faculty) or non-reciprocal (one-way travel of faculty). There is a considerable amount of flexibility in this type of agreement. At this time, CWRU does not have a template, but the Center for International Affairs will work with you to create an appropriate document.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>International Research Agreements</strong> are legal contracts between two or more partners that allow for faculty, scholars, post docs, and/or staff to conduct research in partnership. Due to grants and awards funded by federal governments, private organizations and international agencies, these agreements vary widely. The Office of Research and Technology Management provides all support for the development of these types of international agreements.</p>
                                                                <h3>Step Three: Complete the Approval Form</h3>
                                                                <p>The next step is to fill out and sign the top half of the <a href="/international/documents/global-strategy/International Agreements Approval Form.docx">approval form</a>. By signing the approval form, you are attesting that:</p>
                                                                <ul>

                                                                    <li>The proposed agreement meets the <a href="#international">International Agreement Criteria</a></li>
                                                                    <li>The proposed agreement corresponds to your educational or research agenda, and</li>
                                                                    <li>Sufficient resources exist to implement the proposed agreement</li>

This is necessary in order for subsequent signatories to sign the agreement.</p>
                                                                <p>Once the form and required attachments are complete, submit the documents to the Office of Global Strategy via email (<a href="mailto:agreements@case.edu">agreements@case.edu</a>). At this time, the Center for International Affairs and the Office of General Counsel will review the draft agreement. Once both offices have reviewed and provided initial approval of the language in the proposed agreement, the Associate Provost for International Affairs will return the proposed agreement to you.</p>
                                                                <p>Note that this approval is preliminary; it is not a formal approval of the proposed agreement. Formal approval will come later in the process, as set forth in the next steps.</p>
                                                                <h3>Step Four: Submit the Proposed Agreement</h3>
