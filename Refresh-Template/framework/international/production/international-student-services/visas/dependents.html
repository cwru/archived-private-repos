We highly recommend that you visit our section about <a href=../before-arrival/bringing-family.html> Bringing Family</a> before you make this important decision.
                                                                    <p>If you decide that having your family with you in the United States is best, ISS can guide you through the process for family members to obtain a dependent visa.
                                                                        <p>Family members may choose to either travel with you to Cleveland or joining you later. Family members who will travel with you to CWRU will be provided the appropriate dependent I-20 or DS-2019 so that they can apply for the appropriate F-2 or J-2 visa in your home country. Upon your admission, ISS will request supplementary information from you to process their dependent documents.</p>If your family members will be joining you later to live with you in the US as your dependents, you’ll need to complete and submit a <a href="https://orgsync.com/98468/forms/205214" target="_blank">Request for New I-20 or DS-2019</a> along with financial documentation showing that you can support your family members’ additional expenses. The financial documents should cover your expenses as well as your dependent's expenses: $6,000 in extra living expenses for a spouse and $3,000 per child. This documentation must be less than six months old.</p>
                                                                    <p>Upon receiving your new I-20s or DS-2019s—one for you and one for each dependent—provide your dependents with theirs and a copy of yours. They will take these documents to a <a href=http://www.usembassy.gov/ target="_blank">local consular office</a> and apply for their dependent visa. It also is a good idea to request a Letter of Good Standing from ISS and include it with these new I-20s or DS-2019s.
                                                                        <p>When your family arrives in Cleveland, either with you or later on, please bring their passports to International Student Services so we can make copies for your student file. And bring your family by the office, too—we’d love to meet them!</p>

An ISS advisor will explain how to extend permission to stay for the J-1 and all J-2 dependents, and will know whether you may apply for a new EAD with the application for extension, or after it has been approved. A pending application for extension of stay, or for a new EAD, does not authorize you to continue working.</p>
