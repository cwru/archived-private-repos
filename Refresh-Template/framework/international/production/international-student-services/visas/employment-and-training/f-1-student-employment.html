ISS highly recommends that students attend an in-person workshop hosted by an ISS staff member!  Workshops are offered at various times and locations across campus throughout the year.  Workshop dates are intentionally and strategically planned based on the 90-day application window that USCIS permits and the academic calendar’s graduation dates.  Students are informed in a timely manner about scheduled in-person workshops each semester through ISSNews. Registration is required to attend an in-person workshop. The instructions about how to register are always included as part of the messaging in ISSNews, as are ISS’s expectations for participating students to fulfill the workshop requirement.</p>
                                                                                    <p>ISS also offers an online workshop.  Completing the online workshop consists of first viewing the <a href="https://prezi.com/qol6kaojqepd/opt-workshop-022017/" target="_blank">OPT presentation</a> and then submitting responses to the <a href="http://students.case.edu/partners/international/training.fbsx">OPT Online Training</a> that demonstrate understanding of the complex protocol and requirements regarding OPT and maintaining status. Students who complete an online workshop but who ISS determines need more assistance will need to complete an in-person workshop. The online workshop tools are available year-round; however, students can only access and submit the online training once to fulfil the workshop requirement.  Be sure to follow all instructions carefully. Additional detailed instructions about the online workshop will be provided in ISSNews throughout the year.</p>
                                                                                    <p>USCIS requires students to include an I-20 with an OPT endorsement on it as part of the application. ISS will only process this OPT I-20 for students who have properly completed a workshop and are prepared to submit applications that are 100% complete. Applications that lack required information or documentation will not be accepted by ISS and will be returned to the student to resubmit after all missing documentation is in order. ISS will only accept complete application materials from the student applying and ISS will only return the newly prepared I-20 and completed application to the student applying.</p>

If a student works prior to receiving the EAD or prior to the authorization dates listed on the EAD, this is a violation of visa status and labor law. This is grounds for the termination of the student's visa status and the employer could face serious consequences for having employed someone who is ineligible to work in the US.</p>
                                                                                    <p>When the card arrives, please bring the card itself or a photocopy of the card to the ISS Office so that a copy of the EAD can be kept on file. If a student uses ISS' mailing address to have the card delivered, ISS will take the required copy either at the time that the student picks it up from the office or at the time that the student requests that it be mailed to an address of their choosing.</p>
                                                                                    <p>When a student has secured OPT employment (in the field of study and working for at least 20 hours per week), ISS must be notified. Students must complete the <a href="https://orgsync.com/98468/forms/227362" target="_blank">"Update My OPT Information" </a>form on the ISS OrgSync page to report this important information. This link should also be used to update a change in personal address, report a change in your employer's information, or to confirm that a student has departed the US and no longer wish to remain in F-1 status on OPT.</p>
                                                                                    <p>Remember, in order to properly maintain status while authorized for OPT, a student must never be unemployed for more than 90 days. If a student is unemployed for more than 90 days, that's a violation of visa status. USCIS tracks students' employment status based on the information that's entered in SEVIS. ISS updates SEVIS based on the information that students provide. SEVP recommends that students report changes within 10 business days to avoid situations where a government official may determine the student to be out of status. Based on that guidance, ISS encourages students to report changes in personal contact information and employment to ISS as soon as possible. It is very important that students promptly report this information to ISS; students risk violating their visa status if this required information is not properly documented.</p>

Employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student fails to maintain status. Upon authorization, students may work for an employer at any job, anywhere in the United States. A job offer is NOT required in advance of obtaining this type of employment authorization.</p>

It can take 12 weeks or longer for the employment authorization document to be processed by the Service Center, and employment may not commence until the student obtains the EAD.</p>
