If you did not earn income from a U.S. source, you will not need a SSN or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Dependents, who are being claimed as deductions on a tax return, must have a SSN or ITIN. The Social Security Administration restricts the SSN to individuals who are working, so an ITIN may be required for dependents. If an ITIN is required, the ITIN application (IRS Form W-7) must be sent with the tax return. For more information about the ITIN and how to apply for one, visit the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number-itin" target="_blank">IRS website.</a></p>
