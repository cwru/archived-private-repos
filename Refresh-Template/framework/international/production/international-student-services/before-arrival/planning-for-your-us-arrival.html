In fact, arriving a bit early to campus is a good idea, as it will allow you to get adjusted to the time change and settle into your new surroundings.</p>

Your arrival/departure information will all be recorded electronically by CBP and accessible to you <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/i94" target="_blank">online</a>.</p>
                                                                <p>It is a good practice to access your I-94 Admission Record online after entering the U.S. to check that all of your personal information is correct. You also should print a copy to keep with your immigration documents as proof of your current status in the U.S.</p>
                                                                <p>Be prepared to present this printed copy of your I-94 when applying for a Social Security Number or driver's license and when completing an I-9 Form for employment. There may be other instances in addition to those just mentioned when you'll be asked to present this printed information.</p>
                                                                <p>Paper I-94 cards will still be distributed at land borders with Canada and Mexico. International Student Services encourages you to ask for an I-94 when you are enter the U.S. from Canada or Mexico if you don’t automatically receive one. If you entered the country more than two years ago, your I-94 record will not appear in the online system at this time; your current I-94 card will remain valid.</p>
                                                                <p>For help and for more information on the I-94, download the <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2016-Mar/i-94-automation-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">I-94 Fact Sheet </a> or ask an International Student Services advisor for help.</p>

                                                                <p>Like all entering visitors, you will be asked to explain the reason you wish to enter the United States and to provide information about your final destination. It is important that you explain to the CBP officer that you will be a student at Case Western Reserve University. Also, be prepared to include the address of the university.</p>
                                                                <p>When your inspection is complete, the officer will:</p>

                                                                    <li>Return the I-20 or DS-2019 and passport to you.</li>

                                                                <h3>Funding</h3>
                                                                <p>Even if you have substantial funding from CWRU, you should bring with you approximately $2,000 (USD) to cover immediate expenses for initial supplies and books, settling-in costs such as security deposits for rent, telephone, and utilities. We recommend you bring these funds in a combination of cash (a combination of $1, $5, and $20 bills totaling about $300-600) and the balance in "traveler's checks" in U.S. dollars. Traveler's checks provide a safe way to carry money while traveling in the United States and abroad. They are insured against loss and theft and are more readily accepted in the United States by businesses away from your area of residence than personal checks. Banks sell traveler's checks, for which they charge a small fee of usually 1% for the value of checks purchased.</p>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    Establish a bank account as soon as possible after your arrival in the United States. It is not wise to carry or keep large amounts of cash.

Many of these groups volunteer to meet new students at <a href="http://www.clevelandairport.com/" target="_blank">Cleveland Hopkins International Airport</a> when they arrive. We strongly encourage you to make arrangements with a student group to meet you at the airport well in advance of your planned arrival. </p>
