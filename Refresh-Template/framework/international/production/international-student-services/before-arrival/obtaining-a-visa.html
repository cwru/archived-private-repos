Contact the nearest U.S. consulate as soon as possible to request information about visa application procedures and requirements. This information is generally available on their website.</p>
                                                                <p>An interview with a consular officer—which is now mandatory for all first-time visa applicants ages 14-79—will help determine the outcome of your application. </p>
                                                                <p>Keep in mind that:</p>

                                                                    <li>Proper preparation means providing as much documented proof as possible that you meet the criteria for a <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html#documentation" target="_blank">nonimmigrant visa</a>.</li>
                                                                    <li>Interested parties (such as sponsors) may provide written information to support your application but may not always be allowed to accompany you to the interview; consult the consulate for more information.</li>
                                                                    <li>It is extremely difficult to obtain a visa after an initial rejection of a visa application. Consular officers will reconsider cases if visa applications are denied, but applicants must be able to show additional or new convincing evidence that their circumstances (personal, professional or financial) have changed considerably since the previous application. It’s in your best interest to prepare your first application carefully and to present your case as clearly as possible.</li>
                                                                </ul>

There are many suggestions given here, and it’s important to remember that each consulate and consular officer is different; it is at their discretion to follow different procedures in processing visa applications, require specific documentation to supplement applications, and give more attention to certain criteria than others when reviewing application materials. </p>
                                                                <p>It’s also crucial to remember that each applicant’s case is different and will be considered separately from any other applicant’s case; you may do everything suggested here and be denied a visa while another seemingly less prepared person is granted one.</p>

Your application is likely to be denied if it appears that you have only partial or primary—rather than sole—interest in being a full-time student during your stay in the U.S.</p>
                                                                <p>Document your purpose for applying with a completed <a href="https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/" target="_blank">Form DS-160</a>.</p>

Your immigration document (the I-20 or DS-2019) and acceptance letter issued to you by CWRU will help to support your intention, but your verbal and written statements also will have an impact on the consular officer reviewing your application.</p>
                                                                <h3>Funding </h3>

The document must stipulate the country in which the funds are available as well as the amount of funding available for withdrawal for the purpose of your education.</p>
                                                                <p>Proof of a scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship award can be documented with a letter from the sponsor stating its ability and intention to provide funds. If you receive a financial award from CWRU, the award letter will state the amount of funding provided.</p>

                                                                    <li>Dependents remaining in your country, such as a spouse, children, or elderly parents. Your claim that dependents will rely on you for financial support upon your return to your country might be supported by letters from interested parties (e.g., family members, friends, members of the clergy, social workers, etc.).</li>
                                                                    <li>Employment which you may resume or begin upon your return to your country. The nature of this agreement should be detailed in a contract or letter from your employer.</li>
