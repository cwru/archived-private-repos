                                                                <p><strong>What made you want to study at a U.S. university and CWRU in particular?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My desire to learn more about finance, the current economic situation and my curiosity about American culture drove me to pursue my masters degree in the U.S. because of world class professionals, well designed programs and the academic atmosphere at CWRU, along with quite a lot cultural scenic spots around the university, I came to Cleveland.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite spot on campus, and why?</strong>
                                                                    <br>It's Wade Lagoon. The lake and its surroundings present me with very different scenes in every season. Having a random walk around the lake and seeing geese playing in the water can help me relax me a lot from the pressure and school work.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What do you miss most about your home country? </strong>
                                                                    <br>My family and friends, especially the moments when we share meals and have outings together.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the U.S.?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Before I came to the U.S., I saw some articles talking about how hard it was to really get involved in the circle of other countries because of the cultural difference. However, after I came here, I found something quite different. During the time I devoted doing volunteer work—participating in various student organizations and networking with professionals—I had great improvement in my interpersonal and organizational skills. Based on all these practical experiences, I realized that as long as you are proactive in presenting yourself and patient enough to embrace others' ideas, it's not that difficult to be a global citizen, let alone to be friends with people of different backgrounds.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing about studying in the States that you were surprised was actually true.</strong>
                                                                    <br>Americans are really good at making fun of themselves, and most of time, joking about yourself will let others feel relaxed and see that you're an easygoing person.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is a fun place you have visited in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Cleveland Metroparks are great places to go hiking and have BBQ outdoors with friends.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice would you give to international students arriving to study at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Don't be afraid to talk and ask. In my view, adapting ourselves to a new environment efficiently is a key method to improving our study at CWRU. To achieve this, I suggest newcomers to catch every chance to meet new friends and talk with others to know more about the school and the place you will be living. Besides, please keep in mind that it's okay to ask whenever you don't understand. People here are very nice and would like to help. Last but not least, believe yourself and be confident all the time. Good luck!</p>
