                                                                <p><strong>What made you want to study at a US university and CWRU in particular?</strong>
                                                                    <br>After finishing my undergraduate degree in Sri Lanka, I wanted to do higher studies. Since there are better higher studies opportunities in the US, I decided to apply to some US universities to do my PhD in Physics. The main reason I wanted to apply to US universities is research opportunities. There are many good programs with quality research that I was interested in, which werenâ€™t available in my country. CWRU excels in research.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What do you miss most about your home country?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I miss the weather. My country is a tropical country located near the equator. We only experience rainy and sunny seasons and the temperature varies only between 15 0 C-35 0 C (60-95*F). Along with that, there are lots of various types of fruits and vegetables that I miss very much. Specifically, I miss the weather in Sri Lanka during the winter seasons.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the US?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I am a person who grew up in a place that lacked of diversity. Once I arrived in the US, I was amused by how diverse this country is. I always used to believe that it is easy and safe to be somewhere which has less diversity. But that thought has been changed completely after I lived several months in the US. Even though it is not easy, it is very adventurous and enjoyable to live in a diverse society and experiences I have had are unbelievable.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing about studying in the US that you had heard about before arriving and were surprised it was actually true.</strong>
                                                                    <br>I heard that doing higher studies in US is pretty challenging. I had much confidence that I can do this without a problem, since I am a hard worker. But I was surprised it was actually true when I came to CWRU. It was difficult getting used to the amount of assignments and all the tests!</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice would you give to other international students arriving to study at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Prepare properly for the first year of graduate studies by collecting essential text books, gathering and refreshing all the past knowledge related to the courses that are going to be taken, and be prepared for self-learning which leads to several sleepless nights.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite place to visit in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My favorite is the Natural Science Museum. There are lots of things to see and learn about around the entire museum. The best of them is the Planetarium shows.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What would you like to do after finishing your studies at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I am specializing in Condensed Matter Experiment for my PhD. There are lots of industries present in the US which carry some compatible research work that I might be able to join with. I may work as a Post Doc student after graduation for a while, in order to increase my research experience and then would join in an industry.</p>
