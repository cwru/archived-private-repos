                                                                <p><strong>Where did you study abroad? How did you choose your programs?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I studied in Linköping University in Linköping, Sweden. I chose this program because it was the program promoted by the Cognitive Science Department. Additionally, I tend to get hot easily and I figured Singapore, more than any other option, would leave me looking like I ran a marathon every day. Lucky for me Linköping did not disappoint and I was kept nice and chilly without freezing. In all honesty, I expected it to be much colder than it was. To my surprise, Linköping was more mild than Chicago winter my entire time there.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has studying abroad changed your global perspective?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Studying abroad has changed my global perspective, by breathing life into it. Before this experience I had never left the continental United States, and my travels within its boundaries was minimal at best. Then suddenly one day I hopped on a plan and traveled across the ocean. While in Linköping, I met and became friends with people from all over Europe and beyond. I rubbed shoulders with Swedes, Singaporeans, Chileans, Iranians, and Frenchmen, just to name a few. The vastness of perspectives and stories I heard, opened my eyes to my need to see more if I am going to be a true global citizen. I would be lying if I said I didn’t catch the travel bug, and I can’t wait until I get a chance to go on my next adventure.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How did classes you took abroad differ from courses offered on campus at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>The major difference is that in some of my classes I was given experiential learning. Instead of attending lectures and later taking a test on the material, I was given a group project working with a local Swedish company. The lectures I received helped me progress through the project and it all culminated in laying the ground work for the company’s upcoming projects. The whole experience felt less like a class and more like a real, and in my opinion, enjoyable job.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What was one thing you did abroad that you couldn’t have done in Cleveland?</strong>
                                                                    <br>This question is hard to answer. I did so much I couldn’t do in Cleveland, like going dog sledding, feeding reindeer, taking a train ride across the Öresund Strait, traveling above the Arctic Circle or visiting the Ice Hotel. If I was forced to pick just one to talk about I would have to say that seeing the northern lights was definitely one of my favorites. It was a breathtaking experience.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice do you have for students who are considering study abroad?</strong>
                                                                    <br>In short: DO IT!! My time abroad was easily one of the greatest experiences of my life. Whether its short-term, a semester, or even a year, you should go out and experience the world. I now have friends all over the world, new places I can’t wait to see, and a new perspective on the world we live in.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What places are next on your bucket list?</strong>
                                                                    <br>An easier question would be where don’t I want to go. I’ve had my eyes on Japan for some time but, who knows? I currently have open invitation to visit France, Denmark, the UK, Singapore and Germany.</p>
