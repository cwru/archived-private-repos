                                                                <p><strong>What made you want to study at a US university and CWRU in particular?</strong>
                                                                    <br>The quality of education in the U.S. is respected all around the world. I chose to study here because of the flexible and student centered academic setting. The support and encouragement I received from my family was priceless in my pursuit. </p>
                                                                <p>Case Western Reserve University is one among the top research universities in the country which makes it possible for me to collaborate with faculty and participate in research. Moreover the nutrition program at Case [Western Reserve University] offers a variety of courses that matches my career interests.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What do you miss most about your home country? </strong>
                                                                    <br>I miss my family and friends. I am waiting to meet them again. I certainly miss our culture, traditions and festivals. We have lot of festivals back home which I love to celebrate with my family.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the U.S.?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I had participated in many national integration events in my home country which is a land of diverse cultures. I learned to be tolerant towards different cultures through this. My experience in the U.S. has still broadened my view toward intercultural issues. I heard a lot about the western culture through media and books before coming here. Now, I am able to differentiate between which is true and which is not. As CWRU attracts many intellectual students from all over the world, I am able to get a prismatic view of familiar topics by being here. I have an amazing feel that I am a global citizen now. I have friends from different corners of world.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing about studying in the states that you were surprised was actually true?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I was surprised by the fact that faculty here are very friendly and transparent with their students. People’s health consciousness also surprises me. If the temperature just gets tolerable, I can see lot of people running or jogging.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite spot on campus?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Biomedical Research Building, the place where I arrived on my first day of campus life. Another favorite place of mine is Peet’s coffee in Crawford hall where I meet and hangout with my friends.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is a fun place you have visited in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I visited Lake Erie, Beachwood, Cleveland art museum and have many other places in my bucket list. I am planning to visit Cedar point and Chagrin waterfalls sometime in this summer.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing you tried for the first time while studying at CWRU, and did you like it?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Walking in snow because I have never seen snow in my place back home. I enjoyed it for few days but then of course started waiting for summer to arrive.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice would you give to students arriving to study at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My advice to the future students is “Be open-minded and try to do things in your own way.” Spend some time to explore your passions too. CWRU gives you every opportunity enhance your skills and knowledge. Never hesitate to ask for help. Make use of all the resources we have on the campus to get the best out of yourself.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What would you like to do after you have completed your educational experience at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I am interested in research and I am planning to do my PhD after finishing master's degree here. I would like to pursue my career as an academician in a well-established university or as a researcher in food industry.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What was your favorite class at CWRU, and why?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My favorite class so far is Human Nutrition 434 taught by Dr. Manor. I enjoyed Dr. Manor’s approach to the subject which I already knew.</p>
