                                                                <p><strong>What made you want to study at a U.S. university and CWRU in particular?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I have always wanted to explore new things in order to enrich my life experiences. I came to CWRU because CWRU not only has excellent academic reputation and research opportunities, but also contributes to enhancing cultural diversity at the same time. At CWRU I have more opportunities getting in touch with different kinds of people, and listen to their experiences which are dissimilar to my own. Also, CWRU students are sincere, active and creative, and people here are motivated to pursue things they want. This atmosphere of trust and freedom pushes me to accomplish my goals at CWRU.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the US? </strong>
                                                                    <br>As a SELP [Spoken English Language Partner] mentor in ESS [Educational Services for Students], I always consider different ways of communicating with students who share distinct cultural background. After discussing with various kinds of people, I find that every ethnic group has its uniqueness and common points compared with other groups. One should respect things different from his or her own culture and make efforts to enhance cultural diversity. It is even more significant to explore the reason why cultures are different and how to avoid ideological conflicts.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing about studying in the states that you were surprised was actually true?</strong>
                                                                    <br>Trust. After coming to the U.S., I have been profoundly impressed by the trust people have with each other in the community. In the U.S., there are fewer restrictions and more fairness based on the trust. One can accomplish his or her aim just by making efforts and not worry about other things. Trust also inspires me in my major, computer science. As a result of trust, softwares like Uber and Airbnb can be popularized which change our life a lot. The whole market is in a virtuous cycle which makes more ideas come true.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite spot on campus?</strong>
                                                                    <br>South residential village. After going through the first-year residential life, students have established good friendships. South residential village helps us maintain these relationships, and at the same time gives us more freedom and privacy in each suite. It’s also crucial that the south village is also a part of CWRU campus so that students still have a sense of belonging to CWRU.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is a fun place you have visited in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br>The Q arena. I have seen Demi Lovato’s show there. It is really awesome!</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing you tried for the first time while studying at CWRU, and did you like it?</strong>
                                                                    <br>New student orientation. The orientation was really a big challenge for a person who just arrived at U.S. for several days. In my group, there were no other international students and I felt really awkward because at that time my listening and speaking skills were not really good. Fortunately, my orientation leader was really patient and encouraged me a lot. Although I had a hard time adapting the new environment those days, I still think orientation is a really good way to connect international students with American culture.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What was your favorite class at CWRU, and why?</strong>
                                                                    <br>First-year SAGES [Seminar Approach to General Education and Scholarship] class. I think the first-year SAGES class is really a good way to help students make connections with professors. My SAGES professor is also my academic advisor. She was really kind and gave me lots of instructions both on life and study. Through face-to-face meeting, I gradually became comfortable talking to professors. Also, first-year SAGES class gives international students a basic frame of the research style and critical thinking. It is also helpful for improving students’ academic performance in other classes.</p>
