                                                                <p><strong>What made you want to study at a US university and CWRU in particular?</strong>
                                                                    <br>U.S. universities have the best biology science program, that explains why I am here! Actually I had never been out of my country before, and I wanted to travel so bad! For me U.S. is like a culture melting pot, I could just go and experience all different things within one trip which is really a great deal!</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is your favorite spot on campus?</strong>
                                                                    <br>The first thing came to my mind was the Jolly Scholar. I hanged out with friends there to relax and get to know them better, and it was always such a great time. I actually like the pub so much that I tried to become a server there, however I was always on the waiting list!</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What do you miss most about your home country?</strong>
                                                                    <br>FOOD! Well now that I am a much better cook so I miss my family and friends the most.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>How has your global perspective changed now that you have studied in the U.S.?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My global perspective had been changed over time. When I first came to the country, I was very shy and nervous. I felt very uncomfortable talking to the local people because I was not feeling myself. It had been hard to overcome the language and culture barrier. Luckily, I met some amazing friends here! They convinced me that I can still be a likeable person, and I can still have a great personality no matter what language I speak, which country I am from. I learned so much about myself and how I interact with the world.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>Name one thing about studying in the states that you were surprised was actually true?</strong>
                                                                    <br>American people cannot live without cheese and sugar! It is more of a joke though.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What is a fun place you have visited in the Cleveland area?</strong>
                                                                    <br>I’d say the Cleveland Museum of Art—one of the most distinguished art museums in the world. The museum is comprehensive, it has a great variety of collections, and it is located within walking distance to CWRU campus. Besides, there is a very nice park around the museum, very beautiful in all four seasons.</p>
                                                                <p><strong>What advice would you give to students arriving to study at CWRU?</strong>
                                                                    <br>My takeaway: Never just hang out with students from your own country. Studying in CWRU exposes you to a great variety of cultures. Keep your eyes and mind open, learn from the others and become a better you.</p>
